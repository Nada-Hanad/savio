# Savio - Remote Patient Monitoring System

Savio is a remote monitoring system that helps detect and alert nurses in real-time about potential harms happening to patients, particularly in nursing homes. The system consists of a smart detection system that utilizes cameras to identify incidents such as falls. Once an incident is detected, immediate alerts are sent to nurses, providing them with the room number and possible injuries sustained by the patient. This enables nurses to respond promptly or request intervention in emergency situations, ensuring patients receive the help they need in the shortest amount of time possible, thus increasing their chances of survival.

## Key Features

- Real-time monitoring and detection of patient harms
- Immediate alerts sent to nurses with room number and potential injuries
- Integration with CCTV cameras for cost-effective implementation
- Improved patient safety and response time

## Importance of Timely Response

Timely response is crucial when it comes to patient safety. Research has shown that individuals who remain on the floor after a fall for an hour or longer have an increased risk, and half of them passed away within 6 months. With Savio, instances where patients are unable to get up on their own or go unnoticed by nurses until the next patrol can be minimized. The monitoring system ensures that nurses are immediately alerted, enabling them to provide immediate assistance to patients in need.

## Hackathon Achievement

Savio was realized as a solution during the Devfest hackathon organized by GDG Algiers, where it won first place. The hackathon provided an opportunity to showcase the project's potential and its ability to address an important need in the healthcare industry.
