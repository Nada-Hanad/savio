## Description

Saveio, a remote monitoring system that helps detecting harms that happen to patients in real time and send immediate alerts for nurses to respond; it is preliminary integrated into nursing homes. Our solution consists of a smart detection system that uses cameras to detect possible harms happening to patients, falls for example. Once it is detected an alert is sent to nurses, alongside with room number and possible injuries endured by the patient. the nurse can then respond or ask for intervention in case of emergencies. This system will provide the patients with the help they need in the shortest amount of time possible to increase their chances of survival. A research found that half of those who remained on the floor after a fall for an hour or longer passed away within 6 months. Taking for instance an example of an elderly person who fell and couldn’t get up on their own and haven’t been noticed by nurses until the time of their next patrol, but using our monitoring system, nurses will provide him with the immediate help they need.

In order to this system to work, we only need to install CCTV cameras on the nursing house rooms. These cameras have an average price of 100$, which makes them affoardable to aqcuire.

It was realized in a hackathon **Devfest** organized by *GDG Algiers* in which it got the first place.
